Content of this folder

["script.R"]
The file "script.R"" is meant to run only locally, can be skipped. 
It serves the purpose of dumping a MySQL data base into .rda files by country which you can find in the folder "rda"

["analysis.R"]
The file "analysis.R" performs the following tasks, by country:
1) transforms data in real time series
2) estimates the model with Elastic Net and produces forecasts
3) adapts estimated to deltas as we worked on values
4) performs back-testing, including importance of predictors

["ccodes.csv"]
The file "ccodes.csv" serves to match country codes

["vars.csv"]
Contains the list of selected variables to build the models

["factors.csv"]
Look up table to assign features to factors

["heatmap.R"]
Produces the nice heatmaps with coefficients importance
Also create the product score "average rank * frequency" for each feature
Creates country profiles

["*.rda"]
Data for each country to be used for the analysis

Additional notes:
=================

* The directory "rda" contains all the .rda files. You have to move them to the main root.

* The directory "coef" contains all the output of the estimation step. They will be re-generated by the scripts, you don't have to move them to the main root unless you want to skip the estimation step.

* The directory "plots" contains all the graphical outputs. They will be re-generated by the scripts, you don't have to move them to the main root.

* The directory "clustering" contains the output of the final clustering step. They will be re-generated by the scripts, you don't have to move them to the main root.
